    <h1>Share your Skills</h1>

    <section class="facilitators"><h3>Are you over 55 with sewing experience and want to share your craft?</h3>
        <div id="side">
          Whether you sew by hand or machine, quilt, mend, or create from scratch, we are inviting seniors to pass on their knowledge to a new generation eager to learn the art of practical self-sufficiency. 
          <br><br>To foster intergenerational wisdom sharing and relations, we are prioritizing seniors who have these skills and would be interested in sharing their knowledge in a small group setting.

            <h4>About the Workshops (for facilitators)</h4>
            Workshops are free for youth (15-29) in Toronto, and can be in-person or virtual (depending on the content). Seniors/workshop facilitators, we will work around your availability. Materials and supplies will be sourced by us. 
            <ul><li><b>Virtual:</b> can be at your home, volunteers will come to set up the meeting technology and support with any questions or comments from participants who tune in virtually. Will ask to record the session as a resource for anyone who missed it.</li>
            <li><b>In-Person:</b> we'll book an accessible space for the workshop and have volunteers to assist with set-up and facilitation. Workshops would be small groups of no more than 10 participants.</li></ul>
