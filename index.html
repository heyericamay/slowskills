    <section class="purpose"><h1>Our purpose is to</h1> <h2>host a number of low-barrier workshops that teach basic alteration, repair, and restoration skills that empower queer and
        marginalized youth to divest from climate destructive practices like fast fashion, overconsumption, and overproduction without compromising on
        personal affirming style. We have hosted a number of “Swap Parties” in the past where youth are invited to donate unwanted belongings and freely
        browse the accumulated contributions. As a result, we have a lot of clothing that would make for excellent practice materials for workshops like:
        darning, visible/invisible mending, sewing machine operation, etc. To foster intergenerational wisdom sharing and relations, we would offer
        honorarium to seniors who have these skills and would be interested in sharing their knowledge in a small group setting. Fabrics leftover from these
        sessions will then be reconstituted as material for textile projects, encouraging deeper engagement with clothing as a resource."</h2></section>
